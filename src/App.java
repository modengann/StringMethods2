/** Instructions:
*   Complete the method middle(). It should work as follow:
*   Given a string of odd length, return the string length 3 from its middle, so "Candy" yields "and". 
*   You can assume the given string length will have an odd number of characters and will have a length of at least 3.
*
*   A+ bonus challenge: 
*   Add additional features to the code to demonstrate mastery. Be creative! Show off what you know! 
*   This can be in an additional method or within the main. Use comments to explain what you did!
